### Title
**Heavenly AFH: Your One-Stop Resource Portal for Adult Family Home Operations**

### Introduction

If you're involved in the Adult Family Home (AFH) industry in Washington State, you know how challenging it can be to keep track of all the resources, regulations, and links you need for daily operations. From WAC 388-76 regulations to DSHS forms, from REC training programs to ALTSA resources - everything seems to be scattered across different websites and platforms.

That's why we created **Heavenly AFH**, a comprehensive landing page that brings all your essential resources together in one convenient, easy-to-navigate location.

### The Problem We're Solving

As an AFH provider or administrator, you likely have:
- Multiple bookmarks saved across different browsers
- Important links saved in notes or documents
- Difficulty remembering where specific resources are located
- Time wasted searching for the right form or regulation

This fragmentation not only wastes time but can also lead to missed deadlines, compliance issues, and unnecessary stress.

7. **DSHS** - Department of Social and Health Services links
8. **WABO** - Washington Association of Building Officials information
9. **Resources** - General resources and training materials
10. **Quick Links** - Emergency contacts and important updates
